<h1>The Best Movies According to Kathi</h1>
<h2>My favourite movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Great Dictator</h3>
<p>Charlie Chaplin is brilliant in this movie and is able to combine comedy with the seriuos matter of WWII.</p>
<h3>The Lobster</h3>
<p>Funny and at the same time very strange movie about finding love.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>A story about a young wizard and the fight good against evil. Starting out light the series gets darker as Harry grows up and has to get ready for a final fight.</p>
